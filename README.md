# Getting Started

PromptCloud extracted 400 thousand reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com to find out insights with respect to reviews, ratings, price and their relationships.


This notebook explains how to clean text data. Trend visualization using reviews. 

I trained logistic regression model to predict whether review is positive or not. I also used bigrams to get more accurate result based on some tricky review.

This notebook contains visualization for below topics:

    1.  Top 10 most reviewed products
    2.  Top 10 best brand
    3.  Top 10 worst products
